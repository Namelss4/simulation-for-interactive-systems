# simulation-for-interactive-systems
The different projects and units from the simulation for interactive systems' class, guided by The Nature Of Code by Daniel Shiffman.

Everything on this repository is uploaded on a single commit called "Manual Fork" because the original repository was a private one of our professor, I had to manually copy each project and paste them on a new repository.
